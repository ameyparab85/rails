San Francisco is one of those cities that need no introduction; like Hollywood and New York, this city already enjoys international renown for everything from sightseeing to shopping to entertainment. Popular San Francisco attractions include fine museums, theaters and destination neighborhoods like Chinatown and Union Square, and Fisherman's Wharf. One sure way to see the sights is to book a double-decker bus tour of the city, or cruise out to Alcatraz or over to see charming Sausalito and the giant redwoods of Muir Woods. Other favorite day trips can include a drive up to award-winning wineries in Napa and Sonoma.
